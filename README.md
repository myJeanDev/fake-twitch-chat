# Fake Chat
Fake Chat is a Twitch chat simulator that generates random usernames and messages using JavaScript's text-to-speech API.
It creates fake chatters with names like "DrElephantNippleLover" who spam typical Twitch messagesâ€”roasting streamers ("bro looks like a fucking ancient capybara"), asking about games, or spamming emotes like "POGGERS" and "KEKW".
Each message gets read aloud with random voices and speeds, plus there's a fake typing animation that makes it feel surprisingly real.
You can adjust how fast messages come in, making it perfect for testing stream overlays, pranking friends, or just enjoying the chaos of simulated internet weirdos.
